Check List for the Experiment
---

For this, we designed a pilot experiment where the user(s)
imitate NAO robot' arm movements at three speeds:
(a) 15 frames per seconds;
(b) 30 frames per seconds;
(c) and 45 frames per seconds.
Such experiment were performed for six times by the same participant
in order to test the factor of fatigue or boredoom (Figure~\ref{fig:exp}A ).
