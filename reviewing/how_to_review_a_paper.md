# Once you’ve agreed to complete a review, how do you approach the paper?

## Michael Callaham


* I always read the paper sequentially, from start to finish, making comments
on the PDF as I go along. I look for specific indicators of research quality,
asking myself questions such as: Are the background literature and study
rationale clearly articulated? Do the hypotheses follow logically from previous
 work? Are the methods robust and well controlled? Are the reported analyses
 appropriate? (I usually pay close attention to the use—and misuse—of frequentist
   statistics.) Is the presentation of results clear and accessible? To what extent
   does the Discussion place the findings in a wider context and achieve a balance
   between interpretation and useful speculation versus tedious waffling?


checklist. First, is it well written?
* if what I am reading is only partly comprehensible, I do not spend a lot of
energy trying to make sense of it, but in my review I will relay the ambiguities
to the author.)

*  I should also have a good idea of the hypothesis and context within the first
few pages, and it matters whether the hypothesis makes sense or is interesting.

*  Then I read the Methods section very carefully. I do not focus so much on the
statistics—a quality journal should have professional statistics review for any
accepted manuscript—but I consider all the other logistics of study design
where it’s easy to hide a fatal flaw.
Mostly I am concerned with credibility: Could this methodology have answered
their question?

* Then I look at how convincing the results are and how careful the description
is. Sloppiness anywhere makes me worry

* The parts of the Discussion I focus on most are context and whether the authors
make claims that overreach the data. This is done all the time, to varying degrees.
I want statements of fact, not opinion or speculation, backed up by data.

## Melanie Kim Müller

* I read the digital version with an open word processing file, keeping a list
of “major items” and “minor items” and making notes as I go. There are a few
aspects that I make sure to address, though I cover a lot more ground as well.
First, I consider how the question being addressed fits into the current status
of our knowledge. Second, I ponder how well the work that was conducted actually
addresses the central question posed in the paper. (In my field, authors are
  under pressure to broadly sell their work, and it's my job as a reviewer to
  address the validity of such claims.) Third, I make sure that the design of
  the methods and analyses are appropriate.

* When diving in deeper, first I try to assess whether all the important papers
are cited in the references, as that also often correlates with the quality of
the manuscript itself.


##  Eva Selenko

 * I don’t have a formalized checklist, but there are a number of questions
 that I generally use. Does the theoretical argument make sense? Does it
 contribute to our knowledge, or is it old wine in new bottles? Is there an
 angle the authors have overlooked?

 * I then delve into the Methods and Results sections. Are the methods suitable
 to investigate the research question and test the hypotheses? Would there have
 been a better way to test these hypotheses or to analyze these results? Is the
 statistical analysis sound and justified? Could I replicate the results using
 the information in the Methods and the description of the analysis?

## Walsh

* For me, the first question is this: Is the research sound? And secondly,
how can it be improved? Basically, I am looking to see if the research question
is well motivated; if the data are sound; if the analyses are technically
correct; and, most importantly, if the findings support the claims made in
the paper.


## Fátima Al-Shahrour

* First, I check the authors’ publication records in PubMed to get a feel for
their expertise in the field. I also consider whether the article contains a
good Introduction and description of the state of the art, as that indirectly
shows whether the authors have a good knowledge of the field.

* Second, I pay attention to the results and whether they have been compared
with other similar published studies.

* Third, I consider whether the results or the proposed methodology have some
potential broader applicability or relevance.




# How do you go about drafting the review? Do you sign it?

## Callaham

* Using a copy of the manuscript that I first marked up with any questions that
I had, I write a brief summary of what the paper is about and what I feel about
its solidity. Then I run through the specific points I raised in my summary in
more detail, in the order they appeared in the paper, providing page and paragraph
numbers for most. Finally comes a list of really minor stuff, which I try to keep
to a minimum. I then typically go through my first draft looking at the marked-up
manuscript again to make sure I didn’t leave out anything important. If I feel
there is some good material in the paper but it needs a lot of work, I will write
a pretty long and specific review pointing out what the authors need to do. If the
paper has horrendous difficulties or a confused concept, I will specify that but
will not do a lot of work to try to suggest fixes for every flaw.



## Chambers

* I usually begin my review with a general statement of my understanding of the
paper and what it claims, followed by a paragraph offering an overall assessment.
Then I make specific comments on each section, listing the major questions or
concerns. Depending on how much time I have, I sometimes also end with a section
of minor comments. I may, for example, highlight an obvious typo or grammatical
error.

## Selenko

* After I have finished reading the manuscript, I let it sink in for a day or so
and then I try to decide which aspects really matter. This helps me to distinguish
between major and minor issues and also to group them thematically as I draft my review.
My reviews usually start out with a short summary and a highlight of the strengths
of the manuscript before briefly listing the weaknesses that I believe should be
addressed. I try to link any criticism I have either to a page number or a quotation
from the manuscript to ensure that my argument is understood. I also selectively
refer to others’ work or statistical tests to substantiate why I think something
should be done differently.

## McGlynn

* I work to be conversational and factual, and I clearly distinguish statements
of fact from my own opinions.

## Sara Wong

* My review begins with a paragraph summarizing the paper. Then I have bullet points
for major comments and for minor comments. Major comments may include suggesting
a missing control that could make or break the authors’ conclusions or an important
experiment that would help the story, though I try not to recommend extremely
difficult experiments that would be beyond the scope of the paper or take forever.
Minor comments may include flagging the mislabeling of a figure in the text or a
misspelling that changes the meaning of a common term. Overall, I try to make
comments that would make the paper stronger. My tone is very formal, scientific,
and in third person. I'm critiquing the work, not the authors. If there is a
major flaw or concern, I try to be honest and back it up with evidence.


## Al-Shahrour
* I start with a brief summary of the results and conclusions as a way to show
that I have understood the paper and have a general opinion. I always comment
on the form of the paper, highlighting whether it is well written, has correct
grammar, and follows a correct structure. Then, I divide the review in two
sections with bullet points, first listing the most critical aspects that the
authors must address to better demonstrate the quality and novelty of the paper
and then more minor points such as misspelling and figure format. When you
deliver criticism, your comments should be honest but always respectful and
accompanied with suggestions to improve the manuscript.


# When, and how, do you decide on your recommendation?

## Boatman-Reich
* I make a decision after drafting my review. I usually sit on the review for a
day and then reread it to be sure it is balanced and fair before deciding anything.

## Selenko
* In my experience, most papers go through several rounds of revisions before I
would recommend them for publication. Generally, if I can see originality and
novelty in a manuscript and the study was carried out in a solid way, then I give
a recommendation for “revise and resubmit,” highlighting the need for the
analysis strategy, for example, to be further developed. However, if the
mechanism being tested does not really provide new knowledge, or if the method
and study design are of insufficient quality, then my hopes for a manuscript
are rather low.

# How long does it take you to review a paper?

## Spaldin
* This varies widely, from a few minutes if there is clearly a major problem with
the paper to half a day if the paper is really interesting but there are aspects
that I don't understand.

## Walsh
* It usually takes me a few hours.  Most of the time is spent closely reading the
paper and taking notes. Once I have the notes, writing the review itself generally
takes less than an hour.

## Selenko
* It can take me quite a long time to write a good review, sometimes a full day
of work and sometimes even longer. The detailed reading and the sense-making process,
in particular, takes a long time. Also, sometimes I notice that something is
not quite right but can’t quite put my finger on it until I have properly
digested the manuscript.

## Giri
* In my experience, the submission deadline for reviews usually ranges between
3 working days to up to 3 weeks. As a rule of thumb, I roughly devote 20% of my
reviewing time to a first, overall-impression browsing of the paper; 40% to a
second reading that includes writing up suggestions and comments; 30% to a
third reading that includes checking the compliance of the authors to the
journal guidelines and the proper use of subject-typical jargon; and 10% to the
last goof-proof browsing of my review. Altogether, it usually takes me more
than a day.


# What further advice do you have for researchers who are new to the peer-review process?

## Selenko
* Remember that a review is not about whether one likes a certain piece of work,
but whether the research is valid and tells us something new. The soundness of
the entire peer-review process depends on the quality of the reviews that we write.

## Wong
As a junior researcher, it may feel a little weird or daunting to critique
someone's completed work. Just pretend that it's your own research and figure out
what experiments you would do and how you would interpret the data.

## Chambers
We like to think of scientists as objective truth-seekers, but we are all too
human and academia is intensely political, and a powerful author who receives a
critical review from a more junior scientist could be in a position to do great
harm to the reviewer's career prospects.
