# First Round Review on 1st August 2017

The English language requires more work, there are cretaing parts
in the work that is hard to follow

absatract
can be improved as it  doenest summarise the main findings of the paper


ABSTRACT
The evaluations of the subjects’ performance and
their impressions about the cooperative play were analyzed
(add a little description of the method )


"not only lets people to enjoy communicating and compete with
other socially, but also lets them observe each other’s feelings
and to find an unexpected aspects of each other."
such sentences, it is in acertaing way hard to follow to which
it is suggested to polish the description.


"As it happens in sports, sometimes, even though it is"
this is a bit confusing, be more acurate in what you want to said.


"As it happens in sports, sometimes, even though it is obvi-
ous how to use the body during a play, frustration emerges
as a result of an inability to move the body in a desired way.
However, repeatedly practicing the same movements helps to
overcome this frustration and gradually alleviates impatience."
this paratgrapht has nothing to do with the paper. also the
English language requires a bit of improvement.


"dyadic" shoiuld it be didactic?

person-to-person person-to-object


In figure 1, the labelling is a bit far from each of the INAMOS, it might also
be useful that you explain the menaing of the whell inside the red circle which
it has also a stop line and possible adding two shadows from the previous movemtns

No need to add e.g. only [5]. (e.g. [5]).

each apex? Can you descrive what is an apex?


Figure 3. "Figures depicts an image."  the caption is redudant here. You might
get some inspiration of other papers to learn about the way they describe a figure.
Also the order is a bit confusing, it can be more understadable if you use
(a) description; (b) desciption and (c) description.


Likert Scale? it is an unfamiliar scale, it might be another speeling mistake.
I didnt know abou the name of the likert scale :)

RESULTS.

You are redundant by mentioning again the aim of the experiment in the result section.


In this experiment, our aim was to understand the importance
of a common task and social reference during a cooperative
play with INAMOs by evaluating the participant’s subjective
impressions about three categories: Skill, Communication and
Interestingness.


The paper made a good point about the experiment that perhabs can be used in the
abstract.
In the light of these verifications, we can
infer that the subjects could share their frustration with their
partners and cooperate towards their common goal together.

the balance of creting a game that is not too bored nor too difficult
it well important to be considered when designnit interactive games.



# Second Round Review on 3rd August 2017

The authors posed an interesting hri scneneario
where INAMO, a japansese swarm robot, is used as third party
to test the communications models to test where intentions and feelings between two
persons lead to the increase of pleasure and alliviate frustrations.
The paper has a good organisation however the methodology, labbeling figure and
 the English language requires major improvements.




## Major Comments


* Your cited work should available in case the readers wnat to go further exploration,
in a quick search of triadic interaction in google schoolar I found papers where
you can get a better idea of what has been done regarding this topic. Read the most
cited papers, I believe that they have sth to say.

The following cited work is not available in google scholar,
* Studies on collaborative play and
communications mediated by panel-type robots INAMO)

* Development of a game playing method for a two persons
game using marble gathering tasks.

* Origin and development of social information gathering behavior







# Third Round and Submission of Reviews on XX August 2017


The authors posed an interesting Human-Robot Interaction problem
where INAMO, a japansese swarm robot, is used as third party to test the
communications models to test where intentions and feelings between two
persons lead to the increase of pleasure and alliviate frustrations.
The paper has a good organisation however the methodology, labbeling figure and
mainly the use of English language requires major improvements.
