# First Round of Reviews on 1st August 2017


it sounds a very obvious results

Results show that participants who did the task with cooperative
hole attributed benevolence and predicted future cooperative
behavior in a different task and that participants who did the
task with obstructive hole attributed malice but did not predict
future obstructive behavior.


Mind, its a very abstract term that it is a bit hard to grasp what you mean
mean when you refer to it. In you are talking about the brain,
your stataments in the introdcution about the abstraction of the mind with
the use of PCA is very limited. Mind, or the brain, has certaingly got many
areas of research to which, you should be more speficit about the areas
of the brain that is more related. it is too general refergin to the mind itself
as a representation of multiple relationships between sensory inputs and motor
outpues.



The premise of the experiment is very intersting. the author
make clear explanations about the
of appeareance or physical charactrerists.

For the figure 1. it would be nice if you describe each of the devices that compose
the 1-d stick. It would also be helpful if you add a photo of one person interacting
with the interactive hole.


"Gifu University in Japan" the paper shoudl be anonymalised


"All were ignorant of the purpose of the experiment." to be ignorant is a bit
derogative. You might said, "particpants were not informed about the..."


no acknowegm,ents



# Second Round of Reviews on 1st August 2017

Authors conducted an experiment of a minimal modal interaction with a 1-DOF stick
to assess behavios that are attributed to malice or   benevolence
where twenty-five participanmts
were asked to pulling or spitting out sticks of a hole   in two phases
where pulling in means cooperative and spitting out means obstructive
and the second phase whree pulling means obstructive and sippoint out
means cooperative.
authors used a 7-point Likert scale questions with one-way ANOVA



prediction of behaviors
to
which interacts with particpants to show that


## Major Comments

<!-- * Authors should be consistent when preseting reults, for instance
they propose the use of one-way ANOVE and they use t-test and
chi-square techines to show statistical significance. -->


* The work might be a bit out of the scope of the conferrence but
with some polishing you can pose a good research quetsion to solve.



* It might be reasonalble for the authors to re-design the experiment
so as to be more consistency with their outcomes.
Althought, it is mentiooned that Q1 were statistically significant difference
and Q3 and Q4 provide evidence of a cooperative condition

* Authors might invite more participants
and desing a well constrain epxeriment to get more succing
conclussion.




* In the DISCUSSION


## Minor Comments

* Can you extend your introdution by mentioning
applications where the community can use your proposed experiment.
Add the work of the applications

Pretty much, all the abstract were copy and paste of the sections of the
paper.

* Authors used the following sentece twice
one in the abstract and one in the introduction
"Assuming that a mind is a source of variety in behavior is
important in a non-zero-sum situation in which cooperators
and competitors (free riders) are mixed.
In such a context,
one should rapidly differentiate competitors from cooperators
and avoid useless battles against competitors"

"
In the present study, we conducted an experiment to assess
whether human predict future behavior of an agent (a 1-DOF
stick) in a different situation by attributing malice or benevo-
lence.
We developed a stick-mediated interactive hole which
provides minimum modal interaction in a non-zero-sum game
situation.
"

Also, there is an inoncsitency. in the abstract in mentioned
two minute time

"participants were asked to insert as
many sticks as they can to the hole within two minute."
but in the experiment is one minute time
"
Participants were asked to insert as many sticks as
they can to the hole within one minute"


* Provide a better descript for Figure 3, you can conluce more about the
chi-square test.


* Double negative: "Not all of the descriptions are not shown.""
at page 3 above the Figure 2.

* Provide a COCLUSION section
* there is no ACKNOWLEDGMENTS section.







# Third Round and Submission of Reviews on XX August 2017

The authors conducted an experiment of a minimal modal interaction with a 1-DOF stick
to assess behaviors that can be attributed either to malice or to benevolence.
With this in mind, twenty-five participanmts were asked to pulling or spitting out
sticks of a hole in two phases:
(i) where pulling in means cooperative and spitting out means obstructive, and;
(ii) where pulling means obstructive and sippoint out means cooperative.
Authors used a 7-point Likert scale questions with one-way ANOVA to test the
prediction of behaviors.
These are some comments that authors can take into considerating to make a
stronger paper.


## Major Comments

* Don't you think that is a very obvious experiment. I believe that you can
re-design the variables involved in the experiment to make a stronger argument
about the importance of the research.

* It is a shallow argument to say that the mind itself is a representation
of multiple relationships between sensory inputs and motor outputs.

* Mind, its a very abstract term that it is a bit hard to grasp it
in the context of your paper. If you refer to the brain when you said mind,
your stataments in the introduction about the abstraction of the mind with
the use of PCA is certainly very limited. Mind, or the brain, has certaingly
got many lines of research to which, you should be more specific
and more carefully when you refer to the mind.

* It might be helpful for the authors to re-design the experiment
so as to be more consistency with both their metrics and their outcomes.

* The abstract is pretty much a copy and paste of the sections of the paper.
For example:

(1) "Assuming that a mind is a source of variety in behavior is
important in a non-zero-sum situation in which cooperators
and competitors (free riders) are mixed.
In such a context,
one should rapidly differentiate competitors from cooperators
and avoid useless battles against competitors"
(2) "In the present study, we conducted an experiment to assess
whether human predict future behavior of an agent (a 1-DOF
stick) in a different situation by attributing malice or benevo-
lence.
We developed a stick-mediated interactive hole which
provides minimum modal interaction in a non-zero-sum game
situation."

There is also an inconsistency in the abstract in mentioned
"two minute time" where as in the paper said one minute



## Minor Comments


* Can you extend your introduction by mentioning applications
that can be useful for the community of HAI.

* Provide a better description for Figure 3. I believe that you can create
a better argument for the values of the chi-square test.

* "All were ignorant of the purpose of the experiment." to be ignorant is a bit
derogative. You might said, "particpants were not informed about the..."

* For the figure 1. it would be nice if you describe each of the devices in the
1-d stick. It would also be helpful if you add a photo of one person interacting
with the interactive hole.

* Avoid the use of double negatives: "Not all of the descriptions are not shown."

* "Gifu University in Japan" the paper should be anonymalised.

* Add a COCLUSION section

* Add a paragraph for the ACKNOWLEDGMENTS section.
