Having read [How to review a paper](http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/09/how-review-paper),
I have collected some of their ideas and tricks to review papers.

Generally speaking, I am adopting the idea of being giving comments
that ,as much a possible, should be backing all up with scientific evidence.
At the same, comments in the review should be balanced with the aim to make
the paper stronger.

The approach that I will follow for reviewing papers is by taking three rounds
which are described below:

1. Read the whole paper with the aim of having a general understanding. Also
make annotations for further quetsions, spot typos and unclear paragraphs.
Then, let the paper(s) sink for one day or two.

2. Highlight both positive and negative points of the paper(s) taking into
consideration the creating of balanced review. With this mind, I can write
a draft version of the review.

3. Make sure to cover the following points in the review.

  * Start with a general statament emphasasing the novelties of the work and
  highlith the strengths of the paper.
  * Create a bullet list to highly the major comments such as
  important experiments that would help the history
  * Create a second bullet list for minor comments such as
  flagging the mislabeling in a Figure, mispelling

Finally, polish the review and submit it.
Give a final round to check the spelling and to fix extra errors
review before submitting it.
