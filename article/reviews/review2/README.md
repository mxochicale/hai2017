The Review

   This paper presents the design and the preliminary results of an
   experiment investigating the imitation of subjects from Nao’s upper
   body movements. From an overall view point, both of this paper and the
   work it presents are in a very preliminary stage. The idea of applying
   these techniques on rehabilitation or sport science is adequate and there
   is some potential to get some interesting results if the authors continue
   this work. The paper at its current state is not acceptable as an oral
   presentation but should be ok as a poster or a demonstration.
   The most serious issue of this paper is, it is simply too short and many
   details are missing. For the camera-ready revision, the authors should at
   least make the following improvements:
   -    The sensor data representation of the movements is not 1-dimension but
   should be X dimension where X is the number of sensors used. Current
   description of state space reconstruction theory is somewhat misleading.
   -    Papers need to be written in top-down style or will not be
   comprehensive. The authors should not only write what they did in a
   sequential order but also should give the readers an overall image of the
   work at the beginning as well as the reasons of the actual procedures.
   For example, although it can be imaged, the authors should explain why
   they need to represent the movements in less dimension and how the data
   presentation can be utilized after the experiment.
   -    The authors should not only pick up some specific
   (participant-dependent) findings from the experiment results, if those
   findings are not general, they are not useful for the paper readers.
   Instead of that, the authors should provide the analyses of the overall
   tendency of the whole data set. Just some simple statistical information
   can help a lot.
   -    The English presentation of this paper is adequate, but there are some
   careless errors. For example, “non only” in the Head Pose Estimation
   section should be “not only”, the closing parenthesis is redundant of
   Figure 3A in the Results section. A careful proof reading is required.
