The Review

   In the present paper the authors measure human upper body movement using
   intertial sensors attached to the hands. Furthermore head pose
   estimation.
   The authors hypothesis is that not only the intertial sensors provide
   information about movement variability. They propose head pose and facial
   expression as an additional source of information.
   The results show that two participants tend to move their head when they
   move their arms. Furthermore, variability regarding symmetric and
   assymetric movements was discovered.

   The idea of the paper can be understood. Currently there is no clear take
   home message or contribution.

   The advantage of state space reconstruction for the present work should
   be explained in more detail and motivated better. What specifically is
   the advantage of that representation, regarding movement correlations and
   symmetry of movements?

   It should be explained what type of head movement is measured and why
   this type of analysis helps to reveal more than a correlation between
   head movement and arm movement due to upper body movement.

   The relevance of the hypothesis regarding human agent interaction should
   be explained.

   The following sentence makes no sense:
   In the experiment, participant
   were asked to imitate ten upper arm movements performed by
   NAO at a constant speed of 30 frames per seconds.



## Firs Review
I tackle each of the request for the Reviewer 1 as well as
some modifications with the results figures, the abstract and some typos.
I also extend the experiment section and fused with experiment design and
rename some of the subsections.
