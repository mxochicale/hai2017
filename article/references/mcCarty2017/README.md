Dancing at basic rhythm

The quality of female dance is highly correlated with three types of movement:
* greater hip swing,
* more asymmetric movements of the thighs, and
* intermediate levels of asymmetric movements of the arms.



The hypothesis of better dancers are tied more closely (better synchronised)
to the beat of the music
were tested in an experiment where the FFT were used to correlate the
frequency spectrum of the hips and spine to an oscillatory frequency of
the beats of the played music at 2.08 Hz
of 5 best dancers and 5 worst dances out of 39 dancers .

Two movement  parameters are important for my work
* 1asymmetric arm movements, (i.e. the right arm moving independently of the left)
* 2amount of arm movement.
amount others like
3asymmetric thigh movements (i.e. the right upper leg moving independently of the left),
4hip swing,
5and amount of thigh movement (see Methods for more information on quantification of these parameters).


and the different profiles of dance that can be obtaned for each participant
when doing a minimum arm movement, the parcicipant can either:
have low level of hips movemnts  with hight assymetry of thigh movements
or
hight levels of hip swing with low assymetric thigh movements



Interesting facts:

"Fast and changeable movement of the hands has been linked to positive affect in dancers 25".
Saarikallio2013, Dance moves reflect current affective state illustrative of approachâ€“avoidance motivation.

"The significance of and tension between symmetric and asymmetric movement patterns is something that
has received a great deal of attention in the literature on the aesthetics of dance 27.""
