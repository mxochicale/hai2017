There is a dilema with the increase or decrease of data regarding the
velocity of gait activities to which data were normalised in two ways:
(i) every stride was time-normalised to 100 data points per stride
which provides an equal number of data points regardless the velocity;
however it removes the stride-to-stride temporal variations

(ii) 30 strides were re-sampled to be 3000 samples which means that
every strides has more or less 100 samples per stride which permit the
temporal variations.
