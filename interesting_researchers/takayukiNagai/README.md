# Analysis of Children's Motion in Eurhythmics by Takayuki Nagai, SISA2017
Paper ID: SS3-2 (Submission ID: 71)



Mobile sociometer (small device): The devices are secured to
the chest of children, nursery teachers, and instructors by
belts, and 3-axis acceleration, 3-axis angular velocity,
and voice are recorded. Imitation of movement and
increase/sharing of feelings are measured with velocity data,
and music/words are measured with voice data.

The movement of the body regarding imitation is extracted
by the phase difference and the correlation value of the
waveform of the time series data. The square root of the
sum of squares of 3 axes acceleration acquired by the mobile
sociometer is taken as the magnitude of movement. Speech
signals are processed to capture sound energy.

Using the PageRank algorithm, we calculate
the proportion of a person being imitated in the eurhythmics
activity (level of influence). The transition probability matrix
H which is input is shown in Eq.(7). As the motion waveforms
are similar, as the imitation probability is high, each element
of the matrix is found by the cross correlation function of the
waveform.

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am wondering if you have the proceedings of SISA conference 2017.
I am particularly interested in reading the following paper:
