Motor variability is not noise, but grist for the learning mill

Motor varibility is a movement parameter that can be used to 
estimate how fast a participant can learn a specific motor task.
Similarly another aspect of variability is the 
adjustment of experiencing error of motor performance 
from individual to individual and taks to task.
In their experiments, authors tested their hyphotesis in an 
experiment of matching a guide trajectory.

in the first experiment the authors asked 
to match a guide trajectory where two dimensions were explored
one for the first experiments and the other linked to the 
second experiment (unknown to the participant ).
It has been presented a strong correlation with the noise creation
with the first dimension of the experiment and the second dimension 
with faster learning levels.
Not only the noise created in the first stage of exploration of a motor
activity was investigated but the relationship with the task 
and personal dependances.
