	abstract = {When human observers view dynamic random noise, such as television {\textquoteleft}snow{\textquoteright}, through a curved or annular aperture, they experience a compelling illusion that the noise is moving smoothly and coherently around the curve ({\textquoteleft}the omega effect{\textquoteright}). In several series of experiments, we have investigated the conditions under which this effect occurs and the possible mechanisms that might cause it. We contrast the omega effect with {\textquoteleft}phi motion{\textquoteright}, seen when an object suddenly changes position. Our conclusions are that the visual scene is first segmented into objects before a coherent velocity is assigned to the texture on each object{\textquoteright} surface. The omega effect arises because there are motion mechanisms that deal specifically with object rotation and these interact with pattern mechanisms sensitive to curvature.},
